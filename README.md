This code takes in library usage data and generates a visually appealing calendar heatmap using Flask, Calmap, and KULT, my unofficial API for Kyunghee University's library usage data.

With this code, users can quickly and easily visualize their library usage patterns over time, providing insights that can inform future study habits.
